[Think Stats Chapter 4 Exercise 2](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2005.html#toc41) (a random distribution)

>This prompt asked us to plot both the CDF and PDF of 1000 random numbers (generated by numpy.random.random).
>
>Below are two figures and their interpretation. 
>
>> The top figure is the direct answer to the prompt, with the CDF presented as an orange line (bottom), and the PMF as a blue line (top). They are plotted on the same x-axis for clarity. Using a PMF to illustrate the results of random numbers is problematic, as each number will likely have the same probability, and without a cumulative number to describe the results it is difficult to interpret any trend. However, the CDF looks like a straight line with a slope of 1. This result is intuitive, as each number is added to the one before it, and they are all of equal probability.
>>
>> The bottom figure takes the same approach, however uses only 100 randomly generated points as opposed to 1,000. This is a visual guide to what composes the otherwise hard-to-decipher blue block in the first figure.
